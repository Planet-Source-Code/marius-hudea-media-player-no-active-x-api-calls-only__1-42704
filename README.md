A media player that uses no Active-X controls, only Windows API calls. Plays music and movies (even shows subtitles). Playlist included. !!! Please read the documentation included because it contains very important information!!!! i know it still has some very small bugs ( don't affect the functionality ) that can be easily fixed but i am no longer able to work on this at the moment (no soundcard, old PC :( ).
